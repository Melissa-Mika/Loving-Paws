        <p>
            At Loving paws, we train dogs of all sizes to become the loving, nurturing, and comforting friend to assist
            you in times of need. Our dogs learn how to be there for you when you need some extra love and
            encouragement. People with all disabilities, both physical and emotional, have been matched to a therapy
            dog, which is trained just for that person's unique needs. Once matched with their companions, people form a
            strong bond resulting in a friendship that will only evolve and strengthen as time goes on. Our customers
            often claim that their therapy dog has helped them to get through even the most trying times. Therapy dogs
            have an impact that no other human can claim and their <span>unwavering love</span> is apparent when
            interacting with their new found friend.
