            <p>We go through an extensive matching process to make sure our dogs are matched with their appropriate
                companions. We begin learning each dog's personality at birth and make exhaustive efforts to complement
                their match's personality. No stone is left unturned and we even discuss the person's sleep schedule to
                compare to the dog's behavior regarding sleep.</p>

            <p>As we have the dog and their new owner interact together, we put an emphasis of the use of social skills.
                Greetings, saying goodbye, behaving in public, walking together, and being able to read each other are
                just a few of the skills that we focus on. This also helps with matching a person to the appropriate
                companion.

            <p>If your dog is happy and wanting to play, it is sure to ease someone's anxiety or depression. Our dogs
                "treat" their owner's symptoms with unconditional love, nurturing, and by continuing to strengthen the
                bond between themselves and their owner. They truly desire to "heal" their owner in their own way and
                being
                playful and lighthearted is so important. Our customers often contact us to let us know the happiness
                their dog is bringing them.</p>
